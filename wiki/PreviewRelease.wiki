#labels Phase-Deploy
*v1.2.0pre build (1272)*

This build is mainly to help people translate Alliance however it should still be stable enough to use on a daily basis.

This build has only been tested on Windows.

This build doesn't have final version of DB (Next releases may require re-hashing because we plan to better handling duplicates)

You can migrating settings.xml (only) from older versions but it requires:

If present rename lansupport variable to lanmode (Or better delete and re-check lan mode in option window) not doing this = alliance will not start


The next builds should be downloadable and installed through the new auto-updater.

*Every issue you find should be reported to the issues tracker. Please add version and build number.*
